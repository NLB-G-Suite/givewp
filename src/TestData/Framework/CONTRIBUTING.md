## Factories and Seeders

The boundary between Factories and Seeders exists in order to separate the  concerns of creating and persisting data, respectively.

**Factories** creates the definition of the data being generated.

**Seeders** control how the data generated by the factory is used, generally by inserting the data into a database or building an export.

How the data is used is a separate concern from how the data is generated. As an example, a factory can be used to generate donation data (a data structure that has specific requirements) while there may be a database seeder for populating a WordPress installation in addition to an export seeder which may format a static file to be imported at a later time. Maintaining the boundary between data creation and storage allows for different applications of the same information.

## Providers

Providers are available to Factories via the `ProviderForwarder` trait, which is implemented in the abstract factory class, and is inherited by factory implementations. The `ProviderForwarder` introduces a magic method to forward calls for provider data to the appropriate provider class, which is automatically loaded as needed.

Note: Because the `ProviderForwarder` implements autoloading, it is not necessary to explicity register providers.
